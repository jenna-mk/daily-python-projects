# Daily Python Projects Repository
This is a repo for my work completing [Daily Python Projects] (https://dailypythonprojects.substack.com/). It is split into beginner, intermediate, and advanced projects. All my projects include notes and comments for things I'd like to remember, such as syntax, when to use what function, and other thoughts that pop up as I learn.

## KEY ðŸ”‘ 
- \# = comment
- #! = important function to remember
- #! \*\*SYNTAX** = the syntax for the function and explanation of parameters
- #! NOTE = any caveats or significant notes of how to use a function
